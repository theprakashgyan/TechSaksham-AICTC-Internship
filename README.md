# TechSaksham-AICTC-Internship

### Project: AICTE Internship on AI: Transformative Learning with TechSaksham – A joint CSR initiative of Microsoft & SAP

### Objective

To explore and implement an image generation system using Stable Diffusion and ComfyUI, enabling the creation of high-quality and diverse images from textual prompts or noise initialization, while providing an interactive and user-friendly interface for creative AI applications.

### Key Activities

-**Literature Review:**
Studied diffusion models, U-Net architecture, and generative AI techniques.

-**Environment Setup:**
Configured hardware and installed required software, libraries, and tools for Stable Diffusion and ComfyUI.

-**Model Integration:**
Loaded and fine-tuned the Stable Diffusion model using the Diffusers library.
Integrated the model with ComfyUI for interactive visualization.

-**Workflow Development:**
Designed and implemented a pipeline for generating images using text prompts and noise initialization.

-**Parameter Tuning:**
Experimented with resolution, guidance scales, and inference steps for optimal image quality.

-**Image Generation and Analysis:**
Generated diverse images, capturing various creative and realistic elements.
Evaluated image quality and performance metrics.

-**Snapshot Documentation:**
Captured and analyzed generated image snapshots for report documentation.
